**CLOUD MIGRATION PROJECT**

**Planning**
Cloud Solutions Factory ICT has been contracted to provide a data analysis solution to XYZ, a small environmental non-profit organization based in Wichita, Kansas. XYZ is focused on studying the impact of electric vehicles on air pollution and climate change, and has decided to migrate their IT infrastructure to the cloud in order to reduce costs and increase efficiency. As part of this migration, Cloud Solutions Factory ICT will build a data lake and data warehouse to store and analyze the data provided by XYZ.
The ultimate goal is to build a data lake, data warehouse and provide dashboards to the customer using various AWS services. The project involves analyzing and gaining insights from data that comes in various formats through different methods, including manual data load and API call. In this document, we will provide a detailed overview of all AWS services used for cloud migration and highlight the benefits of this transition.

**Implementation**
**Designing the Architecture**

The first milestone was to design the architecture using AWS services and present it to the class. The architecture was developed using the draw.io tool which included our AWS services that we chose. You can see the diagram below:
